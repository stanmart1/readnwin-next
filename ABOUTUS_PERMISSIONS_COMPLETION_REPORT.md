## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- About Us table structure
CREATE TABLE about_us (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  section VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url VARCHAR(500),
  sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  updated_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### API Endpoints Created
1. **Admin About Us API**: `/api/admin/about-us`
   - GET: Fetch all sections (admin view)
   - POST: Create new section
   - PUT: Update existing section
   - DELETE: Remove section
   - Permission required: `content.aboutus`

2. **Public About Us API**: `/api/about-us`
   - GET: Fetch active sections (public view)
   - No authentication required

### Permission Schema
```sql
-- Permissions table structure (existing)
id: integer
name: character varying (unique)
display_name: character varying
description: text
resource: character varying
action: character varying
scope: character varying
created_at: timestamp
```
