# Analytics Timeout Error Fix

## Problem
The admin dashboard was showing "Request timeout" errors when fetching analytics data, causing console errors and poor user experience.

## Root Causes Fixed
1. **Long database query timeouts** - Reduced from 8s to 3s
2. **Multiple separate queries** - Combined into single optimized query for basic stats
3. **Poor error handling** - Added retry logic and graceful fallbacks
4. **Console error pollution** - Fixed FlutterwaveScriptLoader error filtering

## Changes Made

### 1. OverviewStats Component (`app/admin/OverviewStats.tsx`)
- **Improved timeout handling**: Replaced Promise.race with AbortController
- **Added retry logic**: Automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times
- **Better error messages**: More user-friendly error handling
- **Increased timeout**: Extended from 5s to 8s for initial request

### 2. Analytics API (`app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts`)
- **Optimized queries**: Combined user, book, and order counts into single query
- **Reduced timeouts**: Decreased from 8s to 3s for faster failure detection
- **Better fallbacks**: Provides default data when queries fail
- **Simplified structure**: Removed redundant logging

### 3. FlutterwaveScriptLoader (`components/FlutterwaveScriptLoader.tsx`)
- **Fixed error filtering**: Only suppresses Flutterwave-specific errors
- **Preserved analytics errors**: Analytics timeout errors now show properly

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- Single optimized query for basic stats instead of 3 separate queries
- Faster timeout detection (3s vs 8s)
- Automatic retry mechanism

### User Experience
- Graceful error handling with retry attempts
- Better error messages
- Cached data fallbacks

### Reliability
- AbortController for proper request cancellation
- Fallback data when database is slow
- Reduced console error noise

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. Navigate to `/admin` (overview tab)
2. Analytics should load within 3-8 seconds
3. If timeout occurs, automatic retry happens
4. Error messages are user-friendly
5. Console errors are reduced

The analytics timeout error should now be resolved with better performance and user experience.
