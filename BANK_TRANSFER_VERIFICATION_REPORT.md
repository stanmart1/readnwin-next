  - ✅ `createBankTransfer()` - Creates new transfer records
  - ✅ `getDefaultBankAccount()` - Retrieves bank details
  - ✅ `uploadPaymentProof()` - Handles file uploads
  - ✅ `updateBankTransferStatus()` - Admin verification
  - ✅ `getUserBankTransfers()` - User transaction history
  - ✅ `createNotification()` - User notifications

### ✅ 4. API Endpoints
- **All required endpoints are functional:**
  - ✅ `/api/checkout-new` - Order creation with bank transfer
  - ✅ `/api/payment/bank-transfer/initiate` - Transfer initiation
  - ✅ `/api/payment/bank-transfer/verify` - Admin verification
  - ✅ `/api/payment/bank-transfer/upload-proof` - Proof upload

### ✅ 5. Frontend Integration
- **Checkout flow is properly integrated:**
  - ✅ Payment method selection includes bank transfer
  - ✅ Bank account details display correctly
  - ✅ File upload functionality for payment proof
  - ✅ Order status updates in real-time

### ✅ 6. Error Handling
- **Comprehensive error handling implemented:**
  - ✅ Database constraint violations handled
  - ✅ File upload errors managed
  - ✅ Authentication failures properly handled
  - ✅ Network errors gracefully managed

## Test Results Summary

### Database Tests ✅
- All 4 bank transfer tables exist and are accessible
- Default bank account is configured and active
- 5 recent bank transfers found (system is actively used)
- 5 payment proofs uploaded (proof upload working)
- 5 notifications created (notification system working)
- Database constraints properly configured

### API Tests ✅
- Bank transfer API endpoints respond correctly
- Authentication required as expected
- No database errors in API responses

### Service Tests ✅
- Bank transfer creation works correctly
- Transaction reference generation functional
- Bank account retrieval working
- Notification system operational

### Integration Tests ✅
- Checkout flow integrates with bank transfer
- Order creation with payment_processing status works
- Payment status constraint includes payment_processing
- User name queries fixed (first_name, last_name)

## Complete Workflow Verification

### 1. Order Creation ✅
```
User selects bank transfer → Order created → Payment status: payment_processing
```

### 2. Bank Transfer Initiation ✅
```
Bank transfer record created → Transaction reference generated → Bank details provided
```

### 3. Payment Proof Upload ✅
```
User uploads proof → File stored → Notification sent → Admin review pending
```

### 4. Admin Verification ✅
```
Admin reviews proof → Status updated → Order processed → eBooks added to library
```

### 5. User Notifications ✅
```
Notifications sent at each step → User informed of status changes
```

## Recent Activity Evidence

The system shows active usage with:
- **5 recent bank transfers** in pending status
- **5 payment proofs** uploaded (1 verified, 4 pending)
- **5 notifications** created for user updates
- **All transactions** properly linked to orders and users

## Security & Validation

### ✅ Input Validation
- Transaction reference uniqueness enforced
- File upload size and type restrictions
- User authentication required for all operations
- Order ownership verification

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Payment status constraints prevent invalid states
- Transaction rollback on errors
- Audit trail maintained

### ✅ File Security
- Payment proofs stored securely
- File type validation implemented
- Size limits enforced
- Access control maintained

## Performance Considerations

### ✅ Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling configured
- Query optimization implemented
- Transaction management efficient

### ✅ Scalability
- Modular service architecture
- Stateless API design
- Efficient database queries
- Proper error handling
