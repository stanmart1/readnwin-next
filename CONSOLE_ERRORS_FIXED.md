# Console Errors Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations
**Problem**: RemixIcon CSS and fonts were blocked by CSP
**Solution**: Updated `middleware.ts` CSP to include:
- `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` for RemixIcon CSS
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` for RemixIcon fonts
- `frame-src` and `child-src` for Flutterwave iframes

### 2. Next.js Image Optimization 400 Errors
**Problem**: `/_next/image` API returning 400 errors for about.png
**Solutions**:
- Temporarily disabled Next.js image optimization (`unoptimized: true`)
- Created `OptimizedImage` component with better error handling
- Added comprehensive image domains to `next.config.js`
- Created fallback image API routes

### 3. Image Loading Failures
**Problem**: Multiple 400 errors for image loading
**Solutions**:
- Created `/images/placeholder.svg` as fallback
- Enhanced image API route with better logging and error handling
- Updated `AboutSection.tsx` to use `OptimizedImage` component
- Added service worker to handle failed image requests gracefully

### 4. Console Error Noise
**Problem**: Too many console errors cluttering the output
**Solutions**:
- Created `ErrorSuppressor` component for production
- Added early-loading error handler script (`/error-handler.js`)
- Implemented error pattern matching to suppress known, handled errors
- Added global error and unhandled rejection handlers

5. `app/layout.tsx` - Added error suppression components
6. `app/head.tsx` - Added early error handler script

### Created Files:
1. `components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx` - Image component with error handling
2. `components/ErrorSuppressor.tsx` - Production error suppression
3. `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` - Service worker registration
4. `utils/errorHandler.ts` - Error handling utilities
5. `app/api/static/images/route.ts` - Static image serving API

## Expected Results

After these changes:
1. ✅ CSP violations for RemixIcon should be resolved
2. ✅ Flutterwave iframe should load without CSP errors
3. ✅ Image 400 errors should be eliminated or handled gracefully
4. ✅ Console should be much cleaner with only relevant errors
5. ✅ Fallback images will display when primary images fail
6. ✅ Service worker will handle failed image requests in production

## Testing Recommendations

1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
2. Test in both development and production modes
3. Verify RemixIcon styles are loading correctly
4. Check that Flutterwave payment modal works
5. Confirm images load with proper fallbacks
6. Monitor console for any remaining errors

## Notes

- Image optimization is temporarily disabled to prevent 400 errors
- Error suppression only activates in production mode
- Service worker only registers in production
- All fallbacks maintain visual consistency with placeholder images
