# Book Management Delete Functionality Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that both single delete and bulk delete functionality are properly implemented in the Book Management page of the admin dashboard.

## ✅ Single Delete Functionality

### Frontend Implementation (`app/admin/BookManagement.tsx`)

#### State Management
```typescript
const [deletingBookId, setDeletingBookId] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
const [bookToDelete, setBookToDelete] = useState<Book | null>(null);
```

#### Delete Handler
```typescript
const handleDeleteBook = async (bookId: number) => {
  const book = books.find(b => b.id === bookId);
  if (!book) return;
  
  setBookToDelete(book);
  setShowDeleteConfirm(true);
};
```

#### Confirmation Handler
```typescript
const confirmDeleteBook = async () => {
  if (!bookToDelete) return;

  setDeletingBookId(bookToDelete.id);
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/books/${bookToDelete.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE'
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      toast.success('Book deleted successfully');
      loadData(); // Reload data
      setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
      setBookToDelete(null);
    } else {
      const errorMessage = result.error || 'Failed to delete book';
      toast.error(errorMessage);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting book:', error);
    toast.error('Network error: Failed to delete book. Please try again.');
  } finally {
    setDeletingBookId(null);
  }
};
```

#### UI Components
- **Delete Button**: Shows in both mobile and desktop views
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner and "Deleting..." text during operation
- **Confirmation Modal**: Displays book title and warning about permanent deletion
- **Error Handling**: Shows toast notifications for success/error states

### Backend Implementation

#### API Endpoint (`app/api/admin/books/[id]/route.ts`)
```typescript
export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Authentication check
  // Permission check (content.delete)
  // Book deletion via ecommerceService.deleteBook()
  // Audit logging
  // Success/error response
}
```

#### Service Layer (`utils/ecommerce-service.ts`)
```typescript
async deleteBook(id: number): Promise<boolean> {
  return await transaction(async (client) => {
    // Check if book exists
    // Delete related records in order:
    // 1. order_items
    // 2. book_reviews
    // 3. cart_items
    // 4. book_tag_relations
    // 5. reading_progress
    // 6. user_library
    // 7. Finally delete the book
  });
}
```

## ✅ Bulk Delete Functionality

### Frontend Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedBooks, setSelectedBooks] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [bulkActionLoading, setBulkActionLoading] = useState(false);
```

#### Selection Handlers
```typescript
const handleSelectBook = (bookId: number) => {
  setSelectedBooks(prev => 
    prev.includes(bookId) 
      ? prev.filter(id => id !== bookId)
      : [...prev, bookId]
  );
};

const handleSelectAllBooks = () => {
  if (selectedBooks.length === books.length) {
    setSelectedBooks([]);
  } else {
    setSelectedBooks(books.map(book => book.id));
  }
};
```

#### Bulk Delete Handler
```typescript
const handleBulkDelete = async () => {
  if (selectedBooks.length === 0) return;
  
  const confirmMessage = `Are you sure you want to delete ${selectedBooks.length} books? This action cannot be undone.`;
  if (!confirm(confirmMessage)) return;

  try {
    setBulkActionLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/books?ids=${selectedBooks.join(',')}`, {
      method: 'DELETE'
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      toast.success(result.message || `Successfully deleted ${result.deleted_count} books`);
      setSelectedBooks([]);
      loadData(); // Reload data
    } else {
      toast.error(result.error || 'Failed to delete books');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in bulk delete:', error);
    toast.error('Network error: Failed to delete books. Please try again.');
  } finally {
    setBulkActionLoading(false);
  }
};
```

#### UI Components
- **Checkboxes**: Individual book selection
- **Select All**: Select/deselect all books
- **Bulk Actions Bar**: Shows when books are selected
- **Loading State**: Shows progress during bulk operations
- **Confirmation**: Browser confirm dialog for bulk delete

### Backend Implementation

#### API Endpoint (`app/api/admin/books/route.ts`)
```typescript
export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest) {
  // Authentication check
  // Permission check (content.delete)
  // Parse book IDs from query parameter
  // Delete books one by one with error handling
  // Audit logging for each deleted book
  // Return summary with success/failure counts
}
```

## ✅ Security & Permissions

### Authentication
- All delete operations require valid user session
- Unauthorized requests return 401 status

### Authorization
- Requires `content.delete` permission
- Permission checked via RBAC service
- Insufficient permissions return 403 status

### Audit Logging
- All delete operations are logged
- Includes user ID, action type, and metadata
- Separate audit events for single and bulk operations

## ✅ Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- Network error detection and user feedback
- API error message display
- Loading state management
- Graceful fallbacks

### Backend Error Handling
- Comprehensive error categorization
- Detailed error logging
- Transaction rollback on failure
- Partial success handling for bulk operations

## ✅ Data Integrity

### Foreign Key Constraints
- Proper deletion order to avoid constraint violations
- Transaction-based operations for consistency
- Related data cleanup (reviews, cart items, etc.)

### Cascade Effects
- Order items deletion
- Book reviews removal
- Cart items cleanup
- User library entries removal
- Reading progress deletion
- Tag relations cleanup

## ✅ User Experience

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Single delete: Modal with book title and warning
- Bulk delete: Browser confirm with count
- Clear warning about permanent deletion

### Loading States
- Individual book deletion spinner
- Bulk operation progress indicator
- Disabled buttons during operations

### Feedback
- Success toast notifications
- Error messages with details
- Automatic data refresh after deletion
