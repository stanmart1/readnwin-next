## 💻 Integration with Next.js Application

The database is now ready for integration with your Next.js e-reader application. Key integration points:

### API Endpoints Needed
- `/api/reader/settings` - Get/update user reading preferences
- `/api/reader/progress` - Track and retrieve reading progress
- `/api/reader/highlights` - Create/manage text highlights
- `/api/reader/notes` - Create/manage reading notes
- `/api/reader/sessions` - Track reading sessions
- `/api/reader/analytics` - Get reading statistics

### Database Connection
Use the existing `utils/database.js` connection with the provided credentials:

```javascript
const { query } = require('./utils/database');

// Example: Get user reading progress
const progress = await query(
  'SELECT * FROM reading_progress WHERE user_id = $1 AND book_id = $2',
  [userId, bookId]
);
```

## 🔄 Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Frontend Components:** Build React components for the e-reader interface
2. **API Routes:** Create Next.js API routes for database operations
3. **State Management:** Implement reading state management (Redux/Zustand)
4. **Real-time Features:** Add WebSocket support for live progress updates
5. **File Processing:** Implement EPUB/PDF parsing and content extraction
6. **Search Functionality:** Add full-text search across books and notes
