# E-book Upload System Implementation

## Overview
The e-book upload system has been successfully configured to store book files securely on the server filesystem while maintaining metadata in the database. The e-reader can securely access uploaded books through authenticated API endpoints.

## System Architecture

### File Storage
- **Book Files**: Stored in `/storage/books/{bookId}/` (server-side, secure)
- **Cover Images**: Stored in `/public/uploads/covers/` (public access)
- **Temporary Files**: Stored in `/storage/books/temp/`

### Database Tables
- **books**: Enhanced with metadata columns (word_count, estimated_reading_time, chapters, etc.)
- **book_files**: Tracks uploaded files with metadata
- **secure_file_access_logs**: Logs all file access attempts for security
- **user_library**: Links users to their accessible books

## Key Components

### 1. Book Upload Modal (`ModernBookUploadModal.tsx`)
- Two-step upload process (metadata → files)
- Support for EPUB and HTML formats
- Real-time file parsing for page count extraction
- Drag & drop file upload interface

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Service (`enhanced-file-upload-service.ts`)
- Secure filename generation
- File validation and processing
- Background book parsing
- Duplicate detection via file hashing

### 3. Secure File Access API (`/api/secure/books/[bookId]/[filename]`)
- User authentication required
- Book ownership verification
- Access logging for security
- Proper HTTP headers for file serving

### 4. Book File Info API (`/api/books/[bookId]/file-info`)
- Returns file metadata without exposing file paths
- Access control verification
- Used by e-reader for content loading

### 5. Enhanced Book Parser (`enhanced-book-parser.ts`)
- EPUB and HTML parsing support
- Metadata extraction (word count, reading time, chapters)
- Content structure analysis
- Database metadata storage (content stays on filesystem)

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Users can only access books in their library
- Books from paid orders (payment_status = 'paid')
- Free books (price = 0 or status = 'free')

### File Security
- Book files stored outside public directory
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Access logging for audit trails
- File hash verification

### Data Protection
- Book content not stored in database
- Only metadata and structure stored
- Secure file serving with proper headers

## E-reader Integration

### Content Loading
1. E-reader requests book file info via `/api/books/{bookId}/file-info`
2. System verifies user access and returns metadata
3. E-reader loads content via `/api/secure/books/{bookId}/{filename}`
4. Files served with proper MIME types and caching headers

### Supported Formats
- **EPUB**: Full parsing with chapter extraction
- **HTML**: Content parsing with heading-based chapters
- **Cover Images**: JPG, PNG, WebP formats

## Usage Flow

### Admin Upload Process
1. Admin opens book upload modal
2. Enters book metadata (title, author, category, price)
3. Uploads cover image and e-book file
4. System processes files and extracts metadata
5. Book becomes available in admin dashboard

### User Reading Process
1. User accesses book from their library
2. System verifies user has access to book
3. E-reader loads book via secure API endpoints
4. User can read book with full e-reader features
5. Reading progress tracked and saved

## API Endpoints

### Upload & Management
- `POST /api/admin/books` - Upload new book
- `POST /api/admin/books/parse-ebook` - Parse EPUB for metadata
- `GET /api/admin/books` - List books (admin)

### Secure Access
- `GET /api/secure/books/[bookId]/[filename]` - Serve book file
- `GET /api/books/[bookId]/file-info` - Get file metadata

### Library Management
- `GET /api/user/library` - User's library
- `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/library` - Assign book to user
- `POST /api/admin/users/library/bulk-assign` - Bulk assignment

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=production
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=149.102.159.118
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Storage Directories
```
storage/
├── books/
│   ├── {bookId}/
│   │   └── {secure_filename}.epub
│   └── temp/
public/
└── uploads/
    └── covers/
        └── {cover_filename}.jpg
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify system status:
```bash
node scripts/test-ebook-upload.js
```

## Security Considerations

1. **File Access**: All book files require authentication
2. **Access Logging**: All file access attempts are logged
3. **Path Traversal**: Secure filename generation prevents directory traversal
4. **User Verification**: Multiple layers of access control
5. **File Validation**: MIME type and extension validation

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for e-book uploads. Admins can:
1. Upload EPUB and HTML books via the admin dashboard
2. Assign books to user libraries
3. Monitor access through security logs

Users can:
1. Access books from their library
2. Read books using the modern e-reader
3. Have their reading progress tracked

The e-reader will securely load and display uploaded books while maintaining proper access control and security logging.
