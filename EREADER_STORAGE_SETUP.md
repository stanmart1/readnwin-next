# E-Reader Storage Implementation

## ✅ Complete Storage Solution Implemented

### Core Components Created:

1. **BookStorage Utility** (`utils/book-storage.ts`)
   - Manages file storage in both dev and production
   - Creates default HTML content for books
   - Handles directory creation and file operations
   - Updates `book_files` table automatically

2. **Book Content API** (`/api/books/[bookId]/content`)
   - Serves actual book content with authentication
   - Falls back to default content if no file exists
   - Verifies user access before serving content

3. **Storage Initialization API** (`/api/admin/books/initialize-storage`)
   - Admin endpoint to initialize storage for existing books
   - Creates default content for books without file records

4. **Updated EbookContentLoader** 
   - Now uses the new content API instead of direct file access
   - Simplified EPUB handling with HTML fallback

### Storage Structure:
```
storage/
└── books/
    ├── 1/
    │   └── content.html
    ├── 2/
    │   └── content.html
    └── ...
```

### How It Works:

1. **Book Creation**: When an ebook is created, default HTML content is automatically generated
2. **Content Serving**: E-reader requests content via `/api/books/{id}/content`
3. **Access Control**: API verifies user has access via `user_library` or `orders`
4. **Fallback**: If no content exists, default content is created on-demand

### Environment Support:

- **Development**: Files stored in `./storage/books/`
- **Production**: Files stored in `/app/storage/books/`

### Database Integration:

- Updates `book_files` table with file metadata
- Links to existing `user_library` and `orders` for access control
- Maintains compatibility with existing schema

### Usage:

1. **For New Books**: Storage is automatically created during book creation
2. **For Existing Books**: Run the initialization API to create storage
3. **E-Reader**: Works immediately with any book that has storage initialized

### Admin Actions:

```bash
# Initialize storage for all existing books
POST /api/admin/books/initialize-storage
```

The e-reader will now work properly in both development and production environments with proper content storage and access control.
