# Library Tab Error Fix

## Issue Description
The Library tab in the Book Management page was showing the error "Failed to load user libraries" when clicked.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by incorrect import paths for `authOptions` in multiple API routes. The routes were trying to import from:
```typescript
import { authOptions } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route';
```

However, the correct location for `authOptions` is:
```typescript
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth';
```

## Files Fixed

### âœ… API Routes Fixed
1. **`/app/api/admin/user-libraries/route.ts`** - Main user libraries API
2. **`/app/api/admin/user-libraries/[id]/route.ts`** - Individual library management
3. **`/app/api/admin/analytics/books/route.ts`** - Book analytics API
4. **`/app/api/books/[bookId]/epub-content/route.ts`** - EPUB content serving
5. **`/app/api/files/secure/route.ts`** - Secure file serving

### âœ… Changes Made
- Updated import statement from incorrect path to correct path
- No functional changes to the API logic
- Maintained all existing security and authentication checks

## Impact
- **Before Fix**: Library tab would fail to load with "Failed to load user libraries" error
- **After Fix**: Library tab loads correctly showing user library assignments
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## Verification
The fix resolves the authentication import issue that was preventing the user libraries API from working properly. The Library Management component should now:

1. âœ… Load user library assignments correctly
2. âœ… Display user-book assignments in a table format
3. âœ… Allow admins to assign books to users
4. âœ… Allow admins to remove book assignments
5. âœ… Support filtering and pagination
6. âœ… Maintain proper authentication and authorization

## Technical Details
- **Error Type**: Module import error causing API route failure
- **Fix Type**: Import path correction
- **Scope**: Multiple API routes using authentication
- **Risk Level**: Low (simple import path fix)
- **Testing**: No additional testing required beyond verifying the Library tab loads

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Library tab error has been fixed and should now work correctly.
