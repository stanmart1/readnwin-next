- **Authentication**: Required
- **Authorization**: Owner or admin access only
- **Response**: File content with appropriate headers

### Test System
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/payment/bank-transfer/upload-proof/test`
- **Authentication**: Admin only
- **Purpose**: System diagnostics and verification
- **Response**: Directory status and permissions check

## Error Handling

### âœ… Client-Side Errors
- **Network Issues**: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
