# Security Fixes Implementation Complete

## Critical Security Issues Resolved

### ✅ 1. XSS Vulnerability Fixed
- **Issue**: Book content rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `SecurityUtils.sanitizeHTML()` function to remove script tags and dangerous attributes
  - Applied sanitization in `ModernEReader.tsx`, `EReader.tsx`, and `ModernTextToSpeech.tsx`
  - Preserves existing functionality while preventing XSS attacks

### ✅ 2. Log Injection Fixed  
- **Issue**: User input logged without sanitization in multiple components
- **Solution**:
  - Created `SecurityUtils.sanitizeLogInput()` function to remove newlines and control characters
  - Applied to all console.log/error statements in e-reader components
  - Prevents log forging and injection attacks

### ✅ 3. NoSQL Injection Fixed
- **Issue**: Unsafe input used in database queries and DOM attributes
- **Solution**:
  - Created `SecurityUtils.sanitizeDBInput()` and `SecurityUtils.validateBookId()` functions
  - Applied input validation in API routes and DOM attribute assignments
  - Added book ID validation in content API endpoint

### ✅ 4. Division by Zero Error Fixed
- **Issue**: Progress calculation could cause division by zero
- **Solution**: Added guard condition in `ModernProgressBar.tsx` to check if progress > 0

## Files Modified

### Security Utility
- `utils/security.ts` - New security utility functions

### E-Reader Components
- `app/reading/components/ModernEReader.tsx` - HTML sanitization, log sanitization, error fix
- `app/reading/components/EReader.tsx` - HTML sanitization, log sanitization  
- `app/reading/components/ModernTextToSpeech.tsx` - HTML sanitization, log sanitization
- `app/reading/components/TextToSpeech.tsx` - Log sanitization

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **HTML Sanitization**: Removes script tags, event handlers, and javascript: URLs
2. **Log Input Sanitization**: Removes newlines and control characters from logged data
3. **Database Input Sanitization**: Basic sanitization for database inputs
4. **Input Validation**: Validates book IDs to only allow alphanumeric characters and hyphens
5. **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero errors in progress calculations
