# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

## Overview
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities in the e-reader and book management system while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/utils/security-utils.ts` (NEW)
- Created centralized security utility module
- Functions for sanitizing filenames, paths, logs, and HTML
- Path traversal validation

### 2. `/app/api/books/[bookId]/content/route.ts`
**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22/23)**: Sanitized filename extraction and path validation
- **XSS (CWE-79/80)**: Sanitized HTML output in API responses
- **Log Injection (CWE-117)**: Sanitized all logged user input
- **Code Quality**: Improved error handling and readability

**Changes:**
- Added SecurityUtils import
- Sanitized filename extraction from URLs
- Added path safety validation
- Sanitized all HTML content in responses
- Sanitized all logged data

### 3. `/app/api/admin/books/route.ts`
**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22/23)**: Sanitized file extensions and paths
- **XSS (CWE-79/80)**: Sanitized HTML output in responses
- **Log Injection (CWE-117)**: Sanitized logged error messages
- **Performance Issues**: Added database transactions for bulk operations
- **Error Handling**: Added proper cleanup on upload failures
- **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` with proper interface

**Changes:**
- Added EbookMetadata interface
- Sanitized file extensions and paths
- Added transaction wrapper for bulk deletes
- Added cleanup logic for failed uploads
- Sanitized all response data

### 4. `/app/api/ebooks/[bookId]/[filename]/route.ts`
**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22/23)**: Sanitized filename and added path validation

**Changes:**
- Added SecurityUtils import
- Sanitized filename before path construction
- Added path safety validation

### 5. `/app/api/ebooks/[bookId]/extracted/[...path]/route.ts`
**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22/23)**: Sanitized path components and filename

**Changes:**
- Added SecurityUtils import
- Sanitized path components
- Sanitized filename extraction
- Added path safety validation

### 6. `/app/reading/components/ModernEReader.tsx`
**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
- **Performance Issues**: Fixed division by zero in scroll progress calculation

**Changes:**
- Added guard clause for scroll progress calculation
- Fixed SecurityUtils method name

## Security Functions Added

### SecurityUtils.sanitizeFilename(filename)
- Removes path traversal sequences
- Allows only safe characters
- Uses path.basename() for safety

### SecurityUtils.sanitizePath(path)
- Removes path traversal sequences
- Replaces directory separators

### SecurityUtils.sanitizeForLog(input)
- Removes newlines and control characters
- Limits length to prevent log flooding
- Handles non-string inputs

### SecurityUtils.sanitizeHtml(input)
- Escapes HTML entities
- Prevents XSS attacks
- Handles all dangerous characters

### SecurityUtils.isPathSafe(filePath, allowedDir)
- Validates paths stay within allowed directories
- Uses path.resolve() for accurate checking
- Prevents directory traversal

## Testing
Created `/scripts/test-security-fixes.js` to verify all security functions work correctly.

## Impact Assessment
✅ **All existing functionality preserved**
✅ **Critical vulnerabilities fixed**
✅ **Performance improved with database transactions**
✅ **Better error handling and cleanup**
✅ **Type safety improved**

## Deployment Notes
1. Run the test script to verify fixes: `node scripts/test-security-fixes.js`
2. All changes are backward compatible
3. No database schema changes required
4. No breaking changes to API contracts

## Security Compliance
- **CWE-22/23 (Path Traversal)**: ✅ Fixed
- **CWE-79/80 (XSS)**: ✅ Fixed  
- **CWE-117 (Log Injection)**: ✅ Fixed
- **Performance Issues**: ✅ Fixed
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Improved
