# Storage Build Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was failing to start with the error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/app'
```

This occurred because the StorageService was hardcoded to use `/app/storage` as the base path, which doesn't exist in development environments.

## Root Cause
The StorageService and several API routes had hardcoded paths to `/app/storage` and `/app/book-files`, which are designed for containerized production environments but don't exist in development.

## Solution
Implemented environment-aware storage paths throughout the application:

### 1. StorageService.ts
- Changed base storage path to use `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/app/storage' : path.join(process.cwd(), 'storage')`
- Updated all comments to remove "persistent volume" references
- Made the service work in both development and production environments

### 2. API Routes Fixed
Updated the following routes to use environment-aware paths:
- `/app/api/test-image/route.ts`
- `/app/api/images/covers/[filename]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/images/payment-proofs/[filename]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/images/works/[filename]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/images/profiles/[filename]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/payment/bank-transfer/upload-proof/route.ts`

### 3. Utility Services Fixed
- `utils/file-upload.ts` - Updated to use `storage/` directory in development
- `utils/enhanced-file-upload-service.ts` - Fixed cover storage paths

### 4. Directory Structure
Created the following storage directory structure for development:
```
storage/
├── assets/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── payment-proofs/
│   ├── profiles/
│   ├── stylesheets/
│   └── works/
├── books/
│   ├── epub/
│   ├── html/
│   └── pdf/
├── covers/
│   ├── original/
│   └── thumbnails/
├── processed/
└── temp/
```

### 5. Git Configuration
- Added `storage/` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing uploaded files

## Environment Behavior
- **Development**: Uses `./storage/` directory in project root
- **Production**: Uses `/app/storage/` directory (containerized environment)

## Files Modified
1. `lib/services/StorageService.ts`
2. `app/api/test-image/route.ts`
3. `app/api/images/covers/[filename]/route.ts`
4. `app/api/images/payment-proofs/[filename]/route.ts`
5. `app/api/images/works/[filename]/route.ts`
6. `app/api/images/profiles/[filename]/route.ts`
7. `app/api/images/[...path]/route.ts`
8. `app/api/payment/bank-transfer/upload-proof/route.ts`
9. `utils/file-upload.ts`
10. `utils/enhanced-file-upload-service.ts`
11. `.gitignore`

## Result
The application should now start successfully in both development and production environments without the storage directory error. The StorageService will automatically create the necessary directories when needed.

## Testing
The storage directory structure has been verified and all necessary subdirectories are in place. The application should now be able to:
- Initialize storage directories without errors
- Handle file uploads in development
- Work correctly in production with the `/app/storage` path
