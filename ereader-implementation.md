## Key Technical Considerations for Drawer System
- Use CSS transforms for smooth drawer animations
- Implement proper touch event handling to distinguish between drawer swipes and content navigation
- Use z-index layering: backdrop (100), drawers (200), modals (300)
- Handle drawer state in URL or localStorage for better UX
- Optimize drawer content rendering to avoid performance issues
- Ensure drawers work properly in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Add keyboard shortcuts for drawer toggles (accessibility)
- Handle drawer behavior during text-to-speech playback
