# Book Upload Modal Test

## What was fixed:

1. **Add Book Button Issue**: The button was calling `handleAddNew('book')` but the complex form modal wasn't working properly.

2. **Created ModernBookUploadModal**: A clean, 2-step upload process:
   - Step 1: Book Information (title, author, category, price, format, etc.)
   - Step 2: File Upload (cover image + ebook file with drag & drop)

3. **Integrated with E-Reader**: The modal uses the existing `/api/admin/books` endpoint which:
   - Processes and stores book files
   - Generates security tokens
   - Integrates with the e-reader system
   - Handles both ebook and physical book formats

4. **Cleaned up BookManagement**: Removed the old complex form and replaced it with the modern modal.

## Features:

- **Modern UI**: Clean, step-by-step process with progress indicators
- **File Validation**: Proper validation for cover images (JPG, PNG, WebP) and ebook files (EPUB, PDF, MOBI)
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy file upload with visual feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation
- **E-Reader Integration**: Books are immediately available in the reading system
- **Format Support**: Both digital ebooks and physical books

## Test Steps:

1. Go to Admin â†’ Book Management
2. Click "Add New Book" button
3. Fill in book information (Step 1)
4. Upload cover image and ebook file (Step 2)
5. Click "Upload Book"
6. Book should be created and available in the e-reader

The button now opens a modern, fully functional book upload modal that integrates seamlessly with the book system and e-reader.
