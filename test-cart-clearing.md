# Cart Clearing Test Plan

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Checkout API (`/app/api/checkout-new/route.ts`)
- **Added**: Cart clearing immediately after successful order creation
- **Location**: After order creation, before payment method handling
- **Method**: `await ecommerceService.clearCart(userId)`

### 2. Checkout Page (`/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **Added**: Cart context refresh after successful checkout
- **Method**: Calls `secureCart.refreshCart()` or `guestCart.clearCart()` based on authentication

### 3. Payment Verification Endpoints
- **Enhanced Payment Verify** (`/app/api/payment/verify-enhanced/route.ts`): Updated to use `clearCart()`
- **Flutterwave Verify** (`/app/api/payment/flutterwave/verify/route.ts`): Added cart clearing
- **Bank Transfer Verify** (`/app/api/payment/bank-transfer/verify/route.ts`): Updated to use `clearCart()`

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Flutterwave Payment
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Complete order with Flutterwave payment
4. **Expected**: Cart should be cleared immediately after order creation
5. **Expected**: Cart should remain cleared after payment verification

### Scenario 2: Bank Transfer Payment
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Complete order with bank transfer
4. **Expected**: Cart should be cleared immediately after order creation
5. Upload payment proof
6. Admin verifies payment
7. **Expected**: Cart should remain cleared after verification

### Scenario 3: Guest to Authenticated User
1. Add items to guest cart
2. Login during checkout
3. Complete order
4. **Expected**: Both guest and secure cart should be cleared

## Key Implementation Details

### Cart Clearing Points
1. **Immediate**: After successful order creation (all payment methods)
2. **Verification**: After successful payment verification (backup)
3. **UI Refresh**: Cart context refreshed to reflect cleared state

### Error Handling
- Cart clearing failures don't prevent order completion
- Errors are logged but don't break the checkout flow
- Multiple clearing attempts ensure reliability

### Methods Used
- `ecommerceService.clearCart(userId)` - Direct database clearing
- `secureCart.refreshCart()` - UI context refresh
- `guestCart.clearCart()` - Local storage clearing

## Testing Instructions

1. **Manual Test**: Complete a full checkout flow and verify cart is empty
2. **Database Check**: Query `cart_items` table to confirm deletion
3. **UI Test**: Refresh page and verify cart icon shows 0 items
4. **Cross-browser**: Test in different browsers to ensure localStorage clearing works

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the cart clearing can be disabled by commenting out the clearing calls in:
- `/app/api/checkout-new/route.ts` (lines around order creation)
- Payment verification endpoints

The order creation will still work, users will just need to manually clear their cart.
