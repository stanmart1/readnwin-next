# Works Management Auto-Sync Test

## How to Test Automatic Synchronization

### Setup
1. Open two browser tabs:
   - Tab 1: Homepage (`/`) - Shows the Works carousel
   - Tab 2: Admin page (`/admin`) - Works Management section

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Add New Work
1. In Admin tab: Add a new work image
2. In Homepage tab: The new work should appear automatically in the carousel
3. ✅ Expected: Immediate update without page refresh

#### Test 2: Edit Existing Work
1. In Admin tab: Edit title/description of an existing work
2. In Homepage tab: Changes should reflect immediately
3. ✅ Expected: Updated content appears without page refresh

#### Test 3: Toggle Active Status
1. In Admin tab: Deactivate a work (toggle off)
2. In Homepage tab: Work should disappear from carousel
3. In Admin tab: Reactivate the work (toggle on)
4. In Homepage tab: Work should reappear in carousel
5. ✅ Expected: Immediate visibility changes

#### Test 4: Delete Work
1. In Admin tab: Delete a work
2. In Homepage tab: Work should be removed from carousel
3. ✅ Expected: Immediate removal without page refresh

#### Test 5: Reorder Works
1. In Admin tab: Change order_index of works
2. In Homepage tab: Carousel order should update
3. ✅ Expected: New order reflects immediately

### Technical Implementation

The synchronization works through:

1. **localStorage Events**: Admin page triggers `works_updated` event
2. **Event Listeners**: Homepage listens for storage events
3. **Automatic Refresh**: Homepage fetches fresh data when notified
4. **Visibility API**: Updates when returning to homepage tab

### Code Flow

```
Admin Action → localStorage.setItem('works_updated') → 
StorageEvent → Homepage Listener → fetchWorks() → 
Updated UI
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Visibility Change**: Refreshes when tab becomes active
2. **Cross-tab Communication**: Works even with multiple tabs open
3. **Immediate Updates**: No polling delay, instant synchronization

## Verification Complete ✅

The Works Management admin page and homepage Works section are now fully synchronized with automatic updates.
