## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Delete buttons work without errors
- Confirmation modals appear correctly
- Loading states show during operations
- Success messages appear after deletion
- Books disappear from the list
- No console errors
- Database cleanup is complete

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators
- Delete buttons don't respond
- Confirmation modals don't appear
- Loading states don't show
- Error messages appear
- Books remain in list after deletion
- Console errors
- Database inconsistencies

## Browser Console Monitoring

Watch for these log messages during testing:

```
üîç Attempting to delete book {id}...
‚úÖ Successfully deleted book "{title}" (ID: {id})
‚úÖ Audit event logged
```

## Network Tab Monitoring

Check these API calls:
- `DELETE /api/admin/books/{id}` - Single delete
- `DELETE /api/admin/books?ids=1,2,3` - Bulk delete
- `GET /api/admin/books` - Refresh after deletion

## Database Verification (Optional)

If you have database access, verify:
```sql
-- Check if book is completely removed
SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = {deleted_book_id};

-- Check related tables are cleaned up
SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE book_id = {deleted_book_id};
SELECT * FROM book_reviews WHERE book_id = {deleted_book_id};
SELECT * FROM cart_items WHERE book_id = {deleted_book_id};
SELECT * FROM user_library WHERE book_id = {deleted_book_id};
```

All queries should return no results for a successfully deleted book.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Delete button not working**
   - Check if user has admin permissions
   - Verify authentication is active
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Confirmation modal not appearing**

   - Verify database connection
   - Check for foreign key constraint errors

4. **Bulk delete not working**

   - Check API endpoint is correct
   - Monitor network requests

### Debug Steps

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Go to Network tab
4. Perform delete operations
5. Check for errors in both tabs
6. Verify API responses are successful
